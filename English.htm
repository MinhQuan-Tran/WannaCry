  <h3>What Happened to My Computer?</h3>
  <p>
  Your important files are encrypted.<br>
  Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Can I Recover My Files?</h3>
  <p>
  Sure. We guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. But you have not so enough time.<br>
  You can decrypt some of your files for free. Try now by clicking 	&#60;Decrypt&#62;.<br>
  But if you want to decrypt all your files, you need to pay.<br>
  You only have 3 days to submit the payment. After that the price will be doubled.<br>
  Also, if you don't pay in 7 days, you won't be able to recover your files forever.<br>
  We will have free events for users who are so poor that they couldn't pay in 6 months.<br>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>How Do I Pay?</h3>
  <p>
  Payment is accepted in Bitcoin only. For more information, click &#60;About bitcoin&#62;.<br>
  Please check the current price of Bitcoin and buy some bitcoins. For more information, click &#60;How to buy bitcoins&#62;.<br>
  And send the correct amount to the address specified in this window.<br>
  After your payment, click &#60;Check Payment&#62;. Best time to check: 9:00am - 11:00am GMT from Monday to Friday.<br>
  Once the payment is checked, you can start decrypting your files immediately.<br>

  We strongly recommend you to not remove this software, and disable your anti-virus for a while, until you pay and the payment gets processed. If your anti-virus gets updated and removes this software automatically, it will not be able to recover your files even if you pay!
