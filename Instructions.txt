This website is created by Minh Quan Tran in 2020 and to simulate how WannaCry attack computer. 
It does not simulate exactly what WannaCry did.


Windows can be dragged within the browser screen and can be closed by click 'X' button on the top right corner.

There is a test file which contains some words for testing.

Click 'WannaCry.exe' to activate WannaCry.

Once WannaCry is activated, there are some changes:
- The background screen will be changed and the window of WannaCry will appear.
- The test file will be encrypted and it will have '.WNCRY' extension. The browser may not be able to open this file and will download it.
- There are also 2 files that will be available: 
	+ '@WanaDecryptor@.bmp' - background image
	+ '@Please_Read_Me@.txt' - WannaCry FAQ


The time will be count since WannaCry is activated. The price will be double after 3 days.

If the window of WannaCry does not display the message, try re-open it.

Language can be selected in the top right corner. Unfortunately, there are only English and Vietnamese available at the moment.

There are some links available in the bottom left corner for some information.

+ 13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94

The Bitcoin address will be displayed randomly.

Click the 'Check Payment' button to check payment. However, this function is not available and will only show some notifications.

Click the 'Decrypt' button to decrypt the test file.

I downloaded and tested WannaCry from this source: https://github.com/Explodingstuff/WannaCry. 
I will not be responsible for any consequences resulting from downloading and using WannaCry.
